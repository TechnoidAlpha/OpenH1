/*
MENU_PICTURES.C (test)

The menus' pictures drawn again from the player's maps
(port/linux/src/menu_pictures.c): the scale a screen asks for, the cache's
decision (the cached picture drawn, rendered again, or the original kept:
a missing or modded map, a note of another pose or map, a picture too
small, failed renders), the order the preparing pass renders them in and
the pictures it counts (none whose map is missing or modded; with none,
no pass), a render noted before it begins (retried after a failure or a
crash, then given up), a pass resumed at the next start, its notes written
and read back, the colour curve,
the picture cut from the middle of a frame and laid out as the original
frame is. test_menu_pictures.py takes the header (menu_pictures_h.inc), the
constants (config.inc) and the code (under_test.inc).
