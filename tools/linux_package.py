"""Lays out the Linux release (tools/ci_build.py), and zips it:

    python tools/linux_package.py tree <folder>    (the tree of this computer's Linux build)
    python tools/linux_package.py zip dist/halo-linux-x86_64-release OpenH1-Linux.zip

The release is a tree laid out as a Unix prefix is, which a package manager
can copy to /usr (or /opt/<name>) as it is, and which a player unpacks
anywhere and starts with bin/openh1:

    install.sh                                 its installer (tools/linux_install.sh: the Steam Deck's)
    bin/openh1                                 the game
    lib/openh1/libSDL3.so.0                    its SDL (the rpath is $ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/../lib/openh1)
    share/openh1/brokers.txt                   internet play's brokers (network.brokers_file)
    share/openh1/masters.txt                   the master servers (network.masters_file)
    share/openh1/relays.txt                    the relays offered (network.relays_file: none in it)
    share/openh1/vr                            only in the VR build's (--vr): install.sh's sign of it
    share/openh1/steam/<kind>.png              Steam's library artwork, which install.sh gives its shortcut
                                               (port/assets/steam, tools/steam_art.py; the VR build's OpenH1 VR's)
    share/applications/openh1.desktop          the desktop entry
    share/icons/hicolor/<n>x<n>/apps/openh1.png  its icon
    share/doc/openh1/                          the READMEs
    share/licenses/openh1/                     the project's licence and those of what it carries

The game finds its files from where it is (port/linux/src/install_layout.c).
install.sh, opened in the unpacked tree, copies it to ~/Applications/OpenH1
and gives it a menu entry and a Steam shortcut: the release's zips have it,
the tree for a package (tree, below) has not.

tree lays out a Linux build (build/linux_x86_64, or build/linux_arm64: the
one of this computer's architecture unless --build names another) in a
folder, for a package built from the sources: its contents go into the
package's /usr, with the SDL the build brings (libSDL3.so.0 and
SDL3-LICENSE.txt), without install.sh. zip writes the folder's files in
name order, with their Unix modes (executables by their place, as GitHub's
artifacts lose the modes), for unzip and the self-updater.
