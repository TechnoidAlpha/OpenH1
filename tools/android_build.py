"""Ninja rules for the Android build (``ninja android``).

The Android port (port/android/README.md) runs the game as ILP32 AArch64
code - 32-bit pointers, as the game's data formats require - inside an
ordinary 64-bit Android app. This graph builds

- the guest image, build/android/halo_guest.elf: the game sources, the
  platform layer shared with the Linux port (port/linux/src) and the guest
  runtime (port/android/guest) with a subset of musl as its C library, all
  compiled by clang for arm64_32-apple-watchos (ARM64_32 in
  tools/guest_arch.py), converted to ELF assembly
  (tools/android_asm_convert.py), assembled for AArch64 and linked at a fixed
  address below 4 GB;
- the host library, build/android/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libmain.so, with the
  Android NDK: the loader and the services the guest calls, over SDL3;
- SDL3 itself, with the NDK's CMake toolchain file;

and stages both, with the SDL3 Java sources, for the Gradle project in
port/android/app, which ``ninja android_apk`` then assembles.
