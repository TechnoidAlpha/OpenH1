/*
XGPU_METAL.M

The Metal backend: what xgpu_metal.h declares. Refer to it for what the
backend does; this file says how.

Frames. Each frame is a command buffer (more where a pixel read waits for
the GPU mid-frame), committed by xgpu_metal_frame_end, and its fence is the
serial of its last command buffer, counted by the buffers' completion
handlers (a queue's buffers complete in order). xgpu_metal_frame_begin
waits for the frame two before it, and takes that frame's place in the
three sets of per-frame resources: the upload ring's chunks and the
visibility result buffer.

Passes. set_targets ends the render command encoder (not for the same
targets: the pass, or the clears waiting for its start, go on); the next
draw or clear begins one, with load actions "load", or "clear" for an
attachment that a clear of the whole of it came first for. Any other clear
is a quad drawn through a clear pipeline. Uploads into a texture the GPU may still read are
blits in the command buffer's order (they end the encoder; the pass goes on
with "load"); into one it cannot, they write the texture at once.

Presentation. A frame's picture (the back buffer's texture) is given to the
presentation (host_metal.m) and the back buffer takes another texture, the
picture's kept as its previous: what draws or reads the back buffer before
a clear of the whole of it copies that in first (texture_contents).

Guest data. A guest range read in place is wrapped in a buffer over the
readable host pages around it, up to a granule of 4 MB, and the buffer is
kept until the guest maps those pages again (xgpu_metal_guest_remapped: a
buffer keeps the pages it was made over, and would not see the new ones).
Ranges that cannot be wrapped are copied into the upload ring.

/* ---------- frame-end discards

A tile-based GPU (Apple's: the iPhone's, the iPad's, Apple silicon Macs')
draws each pass in tile memory and stores its attachments into their
textures at the pass's end: tens of megabytes at the screen's size for a
depth and stencil target, four times the colour's for a multisampled one.
Where nothing reads them before they are cleared again, the store is
wasted. The last pass of a frame decides its depth, stencil and
multisampled colour attachments' stores as it ends (deferred store
actions): a target whose first use in each of the last
FRAME_END_DISCARD_FRAMES frames was a clear of the whole of it (not a
load, a draw's read, a copy or a resolve) has its contents at the frame's
end discarded (a multisampled colour is resolved, its samples dropped).
The game clears its depth and its multisampled targets at each frame's
start, so their stores at the frame's end go. A first use that is not a
clear starts the count again (and is logged once, if the contents were
discarded: that frame read what the discard left). The other passes, and
the targets read at the next frame's start, store as before.
