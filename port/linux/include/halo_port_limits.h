/*
HALO_PORT_LIMITS.H

Multiplayer session limits of the native builds (Windows, Linux, Android),
force-included by halo_linux_prefix.h.

The Xbox game allows 16 players on at most 4 machines (up to 4 players each
on split screen). The native builds allow 128 players on up to 128
machines; split screen stays at 4 players per machine.

128 is the largest session that fits the game's existing records: player,
machine and team indices are stored in signed chars (0..127 with NONE), and
a finishing place in 7 bits.
