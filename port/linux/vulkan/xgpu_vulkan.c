/*
XGPU_VULKAN.C

The Vulkan backend's core (xgpu_vulkan.h): the device and its memory, the
resources the command stream's draws need, and the commands that draw them.

Recording: the work of a submission is two command buffers, submitted
together. The second (main) has the draws, the clears and what is ordered
between them; the first (early) has the uploads into images and buffers that
no work recorded so far in this submission has used, which can then be done
before all of it, without ending a pass for them. A barrier begins the early
work (after everything submitted before it) and ends it (before everything
after it).

Every image is made in the GENERAL layout and stays in it, sampled, drawn
into and copied; the barrier at the end of each pass and after each copy
makes what it wrote visible to everything after it.

Submissions are numbered by a timeline semaphore. What a submission uses
(its command buffers and descriptor pool, its bytes of the upload ring, the
images and buffers let go of while it was recorded) is reused or freed once
the GPU has passed its number. A frame's visibility tests are read from its
query pool once its last submission is done.

display.hdr (docs/hdr.md). A draw that blends in its shader (its pipeline's
color_read) reads the colour attachment where it draws, as input
attachment 0 of a third descriptor set (VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read:
the attachment stays in the GENERAL layout, which local reads allow, and is
the input of the same index by default). Its reads see the draws before it
through a framebuffer-local barrier before it, or, where the device orders
attachment reads in rasterization order
(VK_EXT_rasterization_order_attachment_access), with no barrier, its own
overlapping triangles in order too. Where the frames are HDR and the
window's display shows HDR, the swapchain is HDR (VK_EXT_swapchain_colorspace:
scRGB's half floats in extended linear sRGB, or HDR10's PQ in BT.2020's
primaries) and the frame is encoded for it (the options' encode) before it
is letterboxed into it as an SDR frame is; the swapchain is made again as
that changes. An SDR swapchain's frame is curved by display.gamma (the
options' gamma) first, where the setting is not 1.

/* ---------- HALO_VULKAN_DISCARDS: the main command buffer in segments

A pass's stores are chosen as its vkCmdBeginRendering is made, before its
draws, but what the later work of the frame does with its attachments is
known only after them. With discards on, the main command buffer's work is
recorded in segments, each into a secondary command buffer: the work
outside passes (copies, uploads, barriers, the present's blit), and each
pass's draws (begun with VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_RENDER_PASS_CONTINUE_BIT
and the pass's formats inherited). At the submission (segments_play) each
pass's vkCmdBeginRendering, vkCmdExecuteCommands and vkCmdEndRendering are
made in the main command buffer, in order with the rest, with stores chosen
from what came after it:

- an attachment that a later pass of the submission clears whole (each
  layer, all of the area) before anything else uses it is not stored
  (DONT_CARE): the clear writes over all of it;
- an attachment that anything else uses after the pass (a later pass that
  loads it or draws over part of it, a draw that samples it, a copy, a
  resolve outside the pass, a readback, the present) is stored, as before;
- the frame's last pass with a depth/stencil image or a multisampled one
  (whose samples are the frame's to draw) does not store what the next
  frame clears first: an image whose first use in each of the last
  DISCARD_FRAMES frames cleared that aspect whole. Any other first use
  starts the count again, and, if the frame before discarded it, is logged
  once (its pixels were undefined for that frame).

A multisampled image's resolve right after the pass that drew it is made
in that pass (resolveMode AVERAGE for colour, SAMPLE_ZERO for depth and
stencil: VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve, Vulkan 1.2's), so a tiler writes
the resolved pixels from its tile memory, not the samples, which are then
stored only where something later loads them; a resolve of samples not
drawn since they were last resolved into the same image, unchanged since,
is not made again (the stream resolves a target it bound and did not draw
into, which would read samples a frame's end discarded). Where the device has lazily
allocated memory, multisampled images are transient attachments in it
(attachments alone: their clear as they are made and their resolves outside
a pass are passes too), whose memory a tiler need never commit. A transient
image that is loaded is still correct: its lazily allocated memory is then
committed (Vulkan's lazily allocated memory keeps what is stored in it,
unlike Metal's memoryless textures).

Without discards (HALO_VULKAN_DISCARDS=0), passes are recorded into the main command
buffer as they are drawn, with every attachment stored. */

/* ---------- aside passes

The game draws into other targets in the middle of its 3D view (the
shadows, the motion sensor, the effects' targets), each in a pass of its
own, which ends the view's pass; the view's next pass then loads what the
one before stored: on a tiler, the whole view written out of tile memory
and read back each time (#335). With aside passes (on with discards;
HALO_VULKAN_ASIDE=0: none), as the Metal backend puts passes aside
(port/macos/xgpu_metal.m):

- a pass that draws colour alone, not multisampled, into other targets
  than the pass recorded before it, and the copies and image uploads
  about it, are put aside: played before that pass, the chain's first;
- the chain's next pass of the same targets, area, layer and views, which
  loads every attachment and stores as the one before it, continues it:
  its pieces are played as one rendering, each piece's secondary command
  buffer executed in it, begun with the first's loads and ended with the
  last's stores and resolves.

What is put aside then comes before pieces drawn before it, which keeps
the frame's pixels where neither reads what the other writes: what is put
aside may not read the chain's targets (sample, copy, resolve them) or
write an image a piece sampled (aside_read). That, a pass with depth or
multisampled, or any other work outside passes (a buffer written in order,
a readback, the lights' upload, the present) ends the chain: from there
everything is played in the order drawn, and the next pass may begin
another chain. A piece resolved in its pass is the chain's last. A buffer the
submission reads that is written again is renamed (buffer_rename), not
written in order, so that it ends no chain. */
