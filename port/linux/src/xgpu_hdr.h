/*
XGPU_HDR.H

display.hdr: the renderer's high dynamic range, one contract that every
backend implements (docs/hdr.md tells it at length). The front end
(d3d8_device.c) decides everything that is the game's: whether the frame is
drawn in HDR, which draws may go past the display's SDR white ("paper
white") and how far, and when the 3D view is tone mapped. A backend draws
what it is told: it makes the screen's target floating point, carries out
each draw's tag (below), runs the tone map and encodes the frame for its
display, filling in only what its display says (the headroom, the output's
encoding).

The frame. The back buffer holds the game's own values, blended by the
game's own maths, in half floats: 1.0 is paper white, the encoding is the
game's (sRGB's curve, extended past 1 as sRGB's extended spaces extend it),
the primaries sRGB's. Nothing is made linear but by the tone map and the
encoding. A value past 1 can only come of blending (every pixel shader's
result is clamped to [0, 1], as the NV2A's is), so a frame whose draws add
no light past white is the SDR frame, value for value.

The draws' tags (nv2a_pixel_shader_key.hdr, decided by xgpu_hdr_classify):

- none: as the game blends it, unclamped. Light the game adds (additive
  effects, plasma, lens flares, the sun, the dynamic lights) keeps what it
  adds past white: the highlights.
- a ceiling (XGPU_HDR_CEILING_*): the draw may not take a channel past
  max(what the pixel had, the ceiling), nor below 0. Paper white for
  surfaces and the HUD whose blend could go past white (a double
  multiply, the specular passes, the fog screens, the HUD's additive art),
  so that they stay where the SDR frame has them without dimming the light
  already there; a glow's ceiling (XGPU_HDR_GLOW) for the deliberate glows
  and the surfaces of light. The backend
  blends such a draw itself in its pixel shader (reading the pixel it
  draws over), with the key's blend (XGPU_HDR_BLEND_*), and its
  fixed-function blending off. The destination's colour as a blend factor
  is the pixel's value, but one less it is never below 0.
- a glow's ceiling (XGPU_HDR_GLOW: the first-person weapon's displays and
  glows; the HUD's flashes and the motion tracker's blips; the surfaces
  that are light, the light of the world the game draws in [0, 1]: a
  teleporter's field, a light fixture, a Covenant energy shield, a plasma
  bolt's light volume) brightened toward the ceiling where it is bright, by
  more of the light the draw added (its own colour: what was under it is
  not brightened): xgpu_hdr_expand.
- XGPU_HDR_ALPHA_LIMIT: destination alpha, which the game reads back as a
  blend factor, stays at most 1 (blended in the shader as above, its colour
  unlimited where no ceiling is set).
- XGPU_HDR_LIGHTS: the enhanced dynamic lights' shoulder (a structure's
  lightmap pass) goes on past white: the same curve below white, and what
  the SDR shoulder squeezed under it rolled off toward
  XGPU_HDR_LIGHTS_WHITE instead (xgpu_hdr_lights).
- XGPU_HDR_UNCLAMPED: the pixel stage carries values past 1 (no clamp
  above, where the NV2A's are: the combiners' results and inputs, the
  pixel's colour), for the screen effects' passes, which copy the tone
  mapped view through their target and back (a scope's warp and mask): they
  keep its light past white instead of cutting it at paper white.
- XGPU_HDR_SELF_ILLUMINATION: a surface whose own pass adds its
  self-illumination to its light (a model's; a structure's lightmap pass,
  which the textures' pass multiplies after) draws as the SDR frame has it
  but for its self-illumination (a door's panel, a computer's screen, a
  Forerunner glyph): the pixel less the same pixel without it (the
  constants of the combiner stages the tag names, its colours, made 0) is
  brightened toward XGPU_HDR_SELF_ILLUMINATION_VALUE as a glow is, where
  it is bright (xgpu_hdr_self_illuminate).

The tone map (xgpu_backend_tone_map) brings each window's 3D view into the
display's range before the HUD is drawn over it: XGPU_HDR_MODE_FAITHFUL
leaves every pixel no channel of which is past 1 as it is; one a little
past it keeps its hue, rolled off softly toward the display's peak, and one
far past it (a core of light the game adds up: an explosion's, a plasma
bolt's) takes the SDR frame's colour (its channels clipped, white-hot as
the SDR frame has it) brightened by the light that was clipped;
XGPU_HDR_MODE_PUNCHY does the same with the whole scene's light lifted and
its bright parts more, under a shoulder that starts lower, so that what is
under white keeps its hue, brighter, and the highlights go further toward
the peak. The encoding (the presentation) makes the frame linear, at most
the peak, times paper white, in the display's encoding. Their shaders are
one GLSL source (xgpu_hdr.c), compiled for each backend
(tools/metal_post_shaders.py, tools/vulkan_post_shaders.py); the C below
is the same maths, the reference the tests hold the shaders to.
