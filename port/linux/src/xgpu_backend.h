/*
XGPU_BACKEND.H

The renderer's two halves and what passes between them. The front end
(d3d8_device.c) is the Xbox Direct3D 8 device: it keeps the game's states
and knows what they mean, and describes each draw in terms of no API: a
pipeline key (everything a pipeline object bakes in: shaders, vertex
layout, blend, depth and stencil, raster state, the targets' formats), the
dynamic state no API bakes in (viewport, scissor, depth range, stencil
reference, blend color, depth bias), the resources bound and the draw's
range. A backend (the host's, Vulkan's or Metal's, through the command
stream: xgpu_stream_encode.c) makes the GPU do it. One backend is built into
an executable; the functions here are its.

Nothing here holds an Xbox value or a GL one: the front end translates the
game's D3D states into these, each backend into its API's. And every call
is plain data, so that a frame's calls can be written into a command
stream and played back elsewhere (the 64-bit host, a thread of its own):
resources are small integers (render targets numbered by the front end),
guest data is a guest address and a size (vertices, indices, textures are
read from guest memory by the backend), structures are passed by value in
effect (arrays and structures are the call's: the backend keeps no pointer
into the front end's), and nothing is
returned that the front end needs within the frame, but for the few calls
marked "answered now" (each says how it could wait). Refer to "The
renderer" in port/linux/README.md.

Vulkan backends keep it reversed, 1 - depth, in a floating-point buffer:

the Xbox's 24-bit integers, steps 1/16777216 at a time, about 9 mm there
(more by the sniper rifle's view than the eye can see: a light a few
millimetres off its wall, as Blood Gulch's bases' are, fights the wall); near
0, where reversed depth puts that point, a float steps a million times finer.
Their emitters write w - z (as one dot product of the projection's rows
where the program has them: xgpu_vertex_program_depth_rows), so that the
precision is not lost first to the vertex's coordinates; the backends test
with each function's mirror, clear to 1 - depth, take the depth range as
1 - its ends, read depth as 1 - it, and add the constant bias in the shader
(the same distance of depth as the Xbox's units, which a float's own units
are not) and the slope's with its sign turned (xgpu_stream.h's
