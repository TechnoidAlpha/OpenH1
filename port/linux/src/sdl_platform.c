SDL_PLATFORM.C

The SDL3 window and event loop behind the ports.

The window is created with the Direct3D device (d3d8_device.c) on the game's
main thread, which is also the only thread that pumps events. Keyboard and
mouse state gathered here feeds the controller emulation in xinput_sdl.c
and the debug keyboard that the game's console reads.

the frame rate holds at the limit while the player plays (a press that

the limit while keys were pressed, #543). The input is read as late as the

events once it returns, and the main loop reads them at once:
frame_pacing.h), so a press during the wait is in the very next frame, read
