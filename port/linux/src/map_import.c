/*
MAP_IMPORT.C

Custom Edition's maps from the player's own copy of its installer
(halocesetup_en_1.00.exe), into the custom_maps folder, where OpenH1 plays
Custom Edition maps from (docs/custom_edition_caches.md): its multiplayer
maps (Halo PC's, Gearbox's among them) and the bitmaps.map, sounds.map and
loc.map they are read with. The reading is ChupathingyCE's
(ce_installer.c, cabinet.c); this is OpenH1's glue to it, for the first
start (first_start.c on Linux and macOS, sdl_platform.c on Windows) and
for the command line (halo --import-maps <file>, server_mode.c), which a
game that already has its Xbox maps uses.

A file the player picks is told apart by its contents: an Xbox disc image
of Halo (xiso.c), Custom Edition's installer, or another CD image. Halo
PC's own CD is one: its maps are Halo PC's (cache version 7, with Halo
PC's own bitmaps.map and sounds.map), which OpenH1 does not play, so the
player is told that the installer has the same multiplayer maps as Custom
Edition's.

Only maps the folder lacks are written, so a map the player has already
(their own bitmaps.map, a newer bloodgulch.map) is left as it is.
