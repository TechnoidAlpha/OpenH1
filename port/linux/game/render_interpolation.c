/*
RENDER_INTERPOLATION.C

Frames between the game's 30 Hz ticks, for the native ports (port/linux,
port/android, port/windows; see port/linux/README.md, "Frame rate").

The game simulates in 30 Hz ticks and originally drew one frame per tick.
The ports draw at the display's refresh rate instead, and every frame shows
the world between the last two ticks: after each tick the camera, every
object's node matrices and the first-person weapon's pose are kept, and a
frame blends the previous and the latest by how far the game clock has run
into the next tick, and so are what an object's shaders read (its function
values and change colors) and a unit's active camouflage. That puts what is
drawn one tick (33 ms) behind the simulation, the usual price of
interpolation. (A Catmull-Rom spline would also need the tick after the pair
it spans: two ticks behind.)

Rotations are blended as quaternions (normalised lerp, taking the shorter
way round), positions and scales linearly. Anything that moves further than
a tick of motion plausibly allows (teleports, respawns, camera cuts) snaps
instead of sweeping across the world, and so does a pose whose nodes moved
too far for one tick: two snapshots of different poses (a model swapped,
another weapon's skeleton, a pose left from seconds before) blended node by
node stretch vertices across the screen. The view cuts whenever its player's
unit changes (a respawn, however near the dead camera was), and a game state
loaded (a checkpoint's revert) leaves no snapshots behind.

Particles, contrails and other effects move every frame (game_frame), and
read the drawn pose of what they hang off. A widget simulated at the
Xbox's own step (an antenna's chain, a cloth flag) is stepped in the tick
instead, and drawn between the shapes the last two ticks left, hung from
its marker as drawn (render_interpolation_shape). A point the HUD works out
from an object's state (a unit's camera, for a waypoint's distance and the
motion tracker's centre) is taken whole as the game has it and moved with
the object as drawn (render_interpolation_unit_camera_position), not mixed
of the tick's position and the frame's markers. A stream of particles from an
object, made in the tick, is held back to be made through the frames between
the ticks (render_interpolation_particle_later).

An object made in a tick has no snapshot from the tick before: one moving
(a bolt, a grenade thrown) is drawn from half a tick of its motion back
(a whole tick back is where it was made, for a bolt the eye), not standing
a tick where the tick left it. A projectile deleted in a tick (at
what it hit) is drawn a tick longer, from its last snapshot to where it was
deleted, as the effects it made there are drawn from the start of the tick:
a ghost, drawn only here, which nothing of the game sees. At 60 and 120 a
projectile is drawn from its newest sub-steps instead (below), its head
start and hold from half a tick back, and its ghost through the sub-step it
was deleted in.

An object the distributed netcode moves to where the host has it
(port/linux/game/network_objects.c) is drawn gliding there over a few ticks
rather than jumping: its snapshots move with it, and the difference is drawn
on top of it, whole until the next tick and fading from then on (no more than
a few world units of it: further is a jump). A local player's view glides so
with their unit, and with what it rides.

At game.sim_rate 60 and 120 (sim_rate.h) an object of the micro lane (a
player's biped, a projectile, an item loose in the world: objects.h's
object_get_lane) moves in the tick's 2 or 4 sub-steps, not once a tick, and
its path through the tick is not the straight line between the tick's
snapshots: a jump's arc, a turn, a start or a stop, a grenade's bounce. Where
each is after every sub-step is kept (the fast phase's
_sim_substep_render_interpolation slot), for two ticks: the one drawn, and
the next, whose sub-steps run while the frames draw the one before
(sim_substep_next). A frame draws it between the poses of the sub-step it is
in (sim_substep_blend: the end of the sub-step before, or of the tick
before for the first, and the end of its own), still a tick behind as
everything else is. Only where it is moves so: its nodes move in the
sub-steps as the tick before posed them (bipeds.c's biped_carry_nodes) and
take the tick's new pose at its last, so the pose, the rotations and what
it carries are blended between the ticks as before, moved by where the
sub-steps put it from where the line between the ticks has it. The
first-person view, which the observer poses from the player's unit, is
moved the same way, and with it the first-person weapon, which is posed
from the view. An object's first two ticks of sub-steps (made, or let go
of: a projectile's head start, a whole tick's travel at once, and its hold)
are drawn between the ticks as before, from a tick's motion back; and one
put somewhere in a tick still open (render_interpolation_object_from: the
VR mode's grenade let go of in a sub-step) is drawn there until the frames
reach that tick. Kept here only, for the frames: the simulation never reads
it. At 30 a tick is one sub-step, nothing is kept, and the frames are as
they were. In a network game, other players and the vehicles they drive are
drawn between their newest two sub-steps instead, the open tick's, not a
tick behind (render_interpolation_lead_wanted, below), and so is every
projectile in any game (render_interpolation_projectile_lead).

A vehicle a player drives (of the micro lane too: vehicles.c) also turns in
the sub-steps, and what it carries (its riders, its gunner, its turret, the
player in its seat) is posed where each leaves it. Its frame (its root
node's place and rotation) is kept after every sub-step as well, and a frame
draws it between two of them, the place lerped and the rotation nlerped the
shorter way round. Its nodes, and those of everything it carries, are blended
between the ticks in that frame (each snapshot's seen from the root node of
the vehicle's own), and placed where the sub-steps' frame has the vehicle:
the vehicle and its riders on its path, turning as it did, and the pose
(its wheels, its turret's aim, a rider's animation) between the ticks as
before. A local player's view from one of its seats (in the first person or
following it, flat or in the VR mode, which poses its eye from the drawn
seat) hangs where the player's unit's camera is on the vehicle (kept, in
the vehicle's frame, at each tick: render_interpolation_camera_anchors). The
view's snapshot is taken back to where the tick left that point, not moved
and turned by the next tick's sub-steps run since, and a frame draws it
moved with that point onto the vehicle's path.

The local player's own view (display.direct_camera) is drawn from the
newest step instead, not a tick behind: on foot, where the newest step left
the player, carried on by the player's velocity; in a vehicle's seat, the
vehicle and what it carries are drawn as the vehicle's newest step left it,
carried on as that step moved and turned it, and the view from the seat with
it (render_interpolation_newest_vehicles). Each aims where the player aims as
the frame takes its view.
