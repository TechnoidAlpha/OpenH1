/*
BASIC_TRAINING.C

The VR build's VR Tutorial (port/linux/README.md, "VR Tutorial";
issue #143): a drill on the player's own Blood Gulch, one thing at a time,
each chapter ending in a small challenge that uses all of it so far.

The main menu's VR TUTORIAL (the VR build's alone, while it plays in the
headset: tools/port_settings.py's _training) lists the chapters, a tick on
each one finished; a chapter chosen starts a game of this machine alone
(a local game, as Multiplayer's PLAY WITH BOTS: no other machine, nothing
sent) of Team Slayer on Blood Gulch with no score or time to end it, and
four bots (bots.c's bots_set_training: three against the player, one with
them), which this file drives. The pause menu's CHAPTERS opens the same
list (menu_tags.c's pause_list_patch), to jump forwards or back to any
chapter; and on the HUD, the D-pad's right skips to the next chapter and
its left goes back one. Jumping in sets the chapter up as it would be had
the ones before it been played: the player put at its place with its
weapons and grenades, the bots at their posts with their orders.

| # | Chapter | Learn | Ends with |
| 0 | Fit check | turning, the comfort vignette, seated or standing, height | the choices made |
| 1 | Boots on the ground | look, move | three marked spots run to |
| 2 | Weapons hot | aim, fire, reload | three still targets down on one magazine |
| 3 | Loadout | the foregrip, switch, pick up and swap | the sniper rifle and the pistol each hitting the target |
| 4 | Hands on | the grenade's throw, the melee | a grenade on a group, then a blow |
| 5 | Eyes up | the scope | (the next drop) |
| 6 | Mount up | vehicles | (the next drop) |
| 7 | Live fire | everything | one against one, then two against two with a bot teammate |

Each chapter is steps (basic_training_steps), each with a check of what
the player did since it began (basic_training_step_result, from what this
file sees of their unit each tick: basic_training_seen) and the set up it
needs (the bots' orders, things placed). A step's words are the HUD's own
text, in the HUD's font and colour, in a light drill instructor's voice;
a button they name is named as the HUD's prompts name it in VR (the input
on the controllers in the hands, as the OpenXR runtime names it:
port/linux/src/vr.c's halo_vr_button_name), and lit on the controller in the
hand (vr_hands.c draws a pulsing ring there, with a short buzz of that hand
as the step begins). Done, a step says so on the HUD with the game's own
beep; a chapter done, with the game's countdown's end, and the next one
starts. A challenge failed (the magazine dry with targets standing, the
other side first to the score) is set up again.

Finished chapters are kept in config.toml (vr.training_finished, the
chapters' numbers). debug.training ("<chapter>[:<step>]") starts a training
game at that chapter (and step) from the main menu, for tests and
captures.

Only this machine's game: nothing goes to another, and the training is
never offered in a network game.
