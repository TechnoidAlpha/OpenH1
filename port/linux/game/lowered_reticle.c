/*
LOWERED_RETICLE.C

display.lowered_reticle: the reticle below the middle of the view, as Halo
2's and Halo 3's are, display.lowered_reticle_amount hundredths of the
view's height below it. The aim is the game's: the player's facing, the
unit's aim, the shots, aim assist and its magnetism, the flashlight and
what the network sends are as they were. Only the local render view turns:
it looks above the aim by the angle that puts the aim on the reticle
(lowered_reticle_view, from main.c's set_window_camera_values), so the
world under the reticle is what the shots hit. The HUD draws the reticle
where the aim lands on the screen (lowered_reticle_screen_offset, the one
place that says where), and the first-person weapon is posed along the aim
(lowered_reticle_aim_camera), so it is lower and points at the reticle.

The view turns for the player's own aim, on foot and in a seat, first or
third person (the views display.fov widens: view_fov.c's render_fov_unit);
not dead, in a cinematic, a scripted camera or a view the director holds,
nor in the VR mode, whose view is the head's. A scope's zoom brings the
reticle back to the middle along the zoom's own transition, as Halo 2 and 3
do, for the scope's picture is drawn about the middle.
