/*
NETWORK_PARTY.C

Parties made in a network game (the party itself is port/linux/src/
p2p_party.c's): a player picked on the scoreboard (game_engine.c's player
menu) may be invited to this machine's party (one made for it, this machine
its leader, if it is in none), or, in a party of their own, asked to let
this machine into theirs. The player invited sees a line at the top of the
view, "Bob invites you to their party", with the key that joins it
(controls.party_accept, J; a controller's D-pad Down: the key or the button
as the player plays, input.button_prompts), for PARTY_PROMPT_MILLISECONDS;
let go, it fades. A player asked sees "Bob wants to join your party", whose
key sends Bob the invite, which Bob's machine then takes without asking (it
asked). Joining is a party link's (p2p_party_join_link): the same as opening
openh1://party/<token>. The scoreboard's menu has the accept too.

The link goes only to the player it is for, through the game's connection
(port/linux/NETCODE.md), in messages of OpenH1's own (120 and after), of a
format of their own (PARTY_FORMAT: a machine takes its own alone):

- A client tells the host (_distributed_message_party_up, reliably, over
  its own stream) whether it can party (network.online) and is in a party
  (with the party's tag: p2p_party_tag, 32 bits of its topic, by which the
  machines tell who is in the same party; never the link), when that
  changes and every PARTY_RETELL_MILLISECONDS; its invite to a player (with the party's token) and its ask, as
  its player makes them.
- The host takes them only from the machine's own stream, from one of that
  machine's players, at most PARTY_BURST at once and one each
  PARTY_REFILL_MILLISECONDS after; it sends an invite or an ask on to the
  machine of the player it is for (_distributed_message_party_down,
  reliably), or takes it itself (its own player's). It sends it only to an
  OpenH1 machine of this game (network_standard_machine_is_openh1) that
  told it it can party, so never to an OpenCE machine (nor does
  network_standard_message_goes_to let any of OpenH1's messages go to one).
- The host tells the machines that told it they can party, when it changes,
  who can (_distributed_message_party_players, reliably): each such player,
  and whether they are in a party, and its tag. A player of an OpenCE
  machine, a bot, or a machine of an older OpenH1 (which drops these kinds
  as unknown) is never in it, so no machine offers them anything.

All of this is in OpenH1's games alone (network_standard_agreed_rate): in a
Legacy game a client cannot tell whether its host, or another player, is
OpenH1's. A player muted on this machine (network_voice_machine_muted) is
not heard: their invites are let go.

The pregame lobby and the carnage report have no player menu yet: when they
do, network_party_player_actions and network_party_player_act are theirs too.

Room held for a party (NETCODE.md, "Parties in public games"): a party's
leader joins a game first, and its members follow it in
(port/linux/game/party_menu.inc). So that strangers do not take the slots
meanwhile and split the party, the leader, a client of an OpenH1 game,
asks its host to hold room for its members (_distributed_message_party_hold,
reliably, over its own stream: the hash of each member's tunnel key, which
the party knows it by, p2p_party_member_key_hashes, and which the host knows
the machine joining by, p2p_peer_key_hash), and again when its members
change. The host holds as many as it has room for (its slots free of
players and of other parties' holds, and those of bots that would make room
for players), for PARTY_HOLD_MILLISECONDS, and answers with how many
(_distributed_message_party_held). A host that leads a party holds room for
its own members the same way, without asking. Until a member's player is in
the game, or its hold lapses, its slot is its alone: a machine of no hold is
refused as for a full game (network_party_slot_open, at its join and at each
player it adds), and the advertisement and the server browser's listing
count the slots held as taken. A member's player added takes up its hold,
and in a team game the host puts it on its party's team, if that team has
room (network_party_team_choice). A party's machines are told apart by the
holds they took up, and by their party's tag (as told the host). A machine
asks for holds at most PARTY_HOLD_GRANTS times a game, which each replace
the last. A Legacy host, and an OpenH1 one of an older build (which drops
the kinds as unknown), hold nothing: the browser says there is no room
guarantee (p2p_lobby.c's stamp says which hosts hold), and the members join
as they can.

A Discord friend's ask to join (port/linux/src/p2p_discord.c) is shown the
same way, in the game and over the menus alike (network_party_discord_draw,
from ui_widget.c's render_ui_widgets): "Bob asks to join your party", with
its keys as the player plays: the accept's (J) and Esc, else the
controller's D-pad Down and Up. port/linux/src/xinput_sdl.c answers it,
taking those keys from the game and the menus while it is shown.
